Undergraduate Research Fellowship
===========

----------------------------------------------------

The Cheriton School of Computer Science offers enrichment opportunities to exceptional students through the Undergraduate Research Fellowship (URF) program to earn at least $15,000 a term for full-time research with a faculty member.

Eligibility
-----------

Students 3A to 4B are eligible to apply, exceptional students from earlier terms will also be considered.  A cumulative average (CAV) of at least 80% is required.  Preference is given to students enrolled in Computer Science major plans.  A student can only do one URF/Co-op per term, and must be on a Co-op term or otherwise not taking courses.

Note: International Students need a SIN# to work in Canada

How to Apply?
-------------

For fall 2019 fellowships the application deadline is June 10, 2019 (11:59 PM).  
Future deadlines will be posted for Winter 2020 and Spring 2020 fellowships.

1. Check eligibility stated above.  Make sure you are eligible before taking the following steps.
2. Prepare a CV/Resume and a one page personal statement.
3. Complete the registration form online.  [Submission Site](https://urf.rcs.uwaterloo.ca/hotcrp/urf-19f)
4. Students are encouraged to find an advisor and indicate this on their statement.  In this case, advisors should write a one page letter of endorsement.

Fellowship Details
------------------

Students will receive a minimum of $15,000/term for their co-op placement

* The School will contribute $7,500/student
* NSERC USRA + faculty to top up the difference

Example: Student X is awarded a research fellowship for a term, the school will provide $7,500 toward their salary.  If they receive an NSERC USRA for $4,500, then the supervisor would need to contribute at least $3,000.  If the student does not get NSERC USRA, the supervisor would need to contribute at least $7,500.
