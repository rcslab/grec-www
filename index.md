Undergraduate Research Fellowship
===========

----------------------------------------------------

The Cheriton School of Computer Science offers enrichment opportunities to exceptional students through the Undergraduate Research Fellowship (URF) program to earn at least $15,000 a term for full-time research with a faculty member.

Eligibility
-----------

Students 3A to 4B are eligible to apply, exceptional students from earlier terms will also be considered.  A cumulative average (CAV) of at least 80% is required.  Preference is given to students enrolled in Computer Science major plans.  A student can only do one URF/Co-op per term, and must be on a Co-op term or otherwise not taking courses.

Note: International Students need a SIN# to work in Canada

How to Apply?
-------------

For Spring 2020 fellowships the application deadline is January 21, 2020 (11:59 
PM).  Future deadlines will be posted later.

1. Check eligibility stated above.  Make sure you are eligible before taking the following steps.
2. Prepare a CV/Resume and a one page personal statement.
3. Complete the registration form online.  [Submission Site](https://urf.rcs.uwaterloo.ca/hotcrp/urf-20s)
4. Students are encouraged to find an advisor and indicate this on their statement.  In this case, advisors should write a one page letter of endorsement.

Fellowship Details
------------------

Students will receive a minimum of $15,000/term for their co-op placement

* The School will contribute $7,500/student
* NSERC USRA + faculty to top up the difference

Example: Student X is awarded a research fellowship for a term, the school will provide $7,500 toward their salary.  If they receive an NSERC USRA for $4,500, then the supervisor would need to contribute at least $3,000.  If the student does not get NSERC USRA, the supervisor would need to contribute at least $7,500.

Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

* **How can I connect with a supervisor?**

You can connect with an advisor in multiple ways. You can approach a faculty 
member and inquiry about their current research project, or you can review the 
following list of advisors and their areas of interest 
https://urf.cs.uwaterloo.ca 

* **Do I need to have a recommendation letter when I apply?**

Yes. We will only accept students who are endorsed by a faculty member.

* **Can a non-CS faculty member endorse me?**

No. Preference will be given to those endorsed by a CS faculty member. 

* **What should I include in my personal statement?**

We want to hear what you are passionate about and why you want to pursue a work 
term in research. 

* **When will candidates be selected for this role?**

This term we will be aligning our recruitment timelines with Waterloo Works and 
intend on notifying successful candidates before rankings are released.

* **Do I need prior research experience to be eligible?**

No! We accept both candidates with and without prior research experience. Just 
tell us why you have a keen interest in research on your personal statement.

* **Will applying through the URF website and Waterloo Works increase my 
  chances of being selected?**

No. We encourage students to select one pathway when applying.

* **Can I apply if I am not a Computer Science student?**

Yes, you can still apply as long as a CS faculty member endorses you.

* **I am an international student, can I still apply?**

Yes, as long as you have a work permit, you can apply.
