      <h1>Undergraduate Research Fellowship</h1>
<hr>
<p>The Cheriton School of Computer Science offers enrichment opportunities to exceptional students through the Undergraduate Research Fellowship (URF) program to earn at least $15,000 a term for full-time research with a faculty member.</p>
<h2>Eligibility</h2>
<p>Students 3A to 4B are eligible to apply, exceptional students from earlier terms will also be considered.  A cumulative average (CAV) of at least 80% is required.  Preference is given to students enrolled in Computer Science major plans.  A student can only do one URF/Co-op per term, and must be on a Co-op term or otherwise not taking courses.</p>
<p>Note: International Students need a SIN# to work in Canada</p>
<h2>How to Apply?</h2>
<p>For Winter 2020 fellowships the application deadline is September 20, 2019 
(11:59 PM).  Future deadlines will be posted for Spring 2020 fellowships.</p>
<ol>
<li>Check eligibility stated above.  Make sure you are eligible before taking the following steps.</li>
<li>Prepare a CV/Resume and a one page personal statement.</li>
<li>Complete the registration form online.  <a href="https://urf.rcs.uwaterloo.ca/hotcrp/urf-20w">Submission Site</a></li>
<li>Students are encouraged to find an advisor and indicate this on their statement.  In this case, advisors should write a one page letter of endorsement.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Fellowship Details</h2>
<p>Students will receive a minimum of $15,000/term for their co-op placement</p>
<ul>
<li>The School will contribute $7,500/student</li>
<li>NSERC USRA + faculty to top up the difference</li>
</ul>
<p>Example: Student X is awarded a research fellowship for a term, the school will provide $7,500 toward their salary.  If they receive an NSERC USRA for $4,500, then the supervisor would need to contribute at least $3,000.  If the student does not get NSERC USRA, the supervisor would need to contribute at least $7,500.</p>
<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
